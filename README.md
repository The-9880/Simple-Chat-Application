# Simple-Chat-Application
Utilizing the Boost Asio library, I'm creating a TCP chat client/server for fun and as a way of getting familiar with the principles of 
network programming. There are a lot of potential updates to the client so far, which currently only supports the transmission of text, 
but they'll be released only as my schedule allows.
